## Hi, I'm Jennifer Nguyen, a new Computer Science/Mathematics graduate from Colgate University 👋

## 🚀 About Me
- 💡 **Dabbling in Data and Development**
  
  I started with a love for coding but ended up loving building tools and systems to extract actionable insights from data.
- 🌱 **Building and Optimizing**
  
  I've been working on **building applications** and **using data for smarter decision-making**. 
- 🎯 **Exploring new tools and technologies**
  
  I get a bit restless when I'm not learning/doing something new. Currently expanding my skills in **data analysis**, **ML modeling**, and **cloud computing**.
