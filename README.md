## Hi, I'm Jennifer Nguyen, a new Computer Science/Mathematics graduate from Colgate University 👋

## 🌟 About Me
- 💡 **Dabbling in Data and Development**: I started with a love for coding but ended up loving building tools and systems to extract actionable insights from data.
- 🌱 **Building and Optimizing**: I've been working on **building applications** and **using data for smarter decision-making**. 
- 🎯 **Exploring new tools and technologies**: I get restless when I'm not learning/doing something new. Currently expanding my skills in **data analysis**, **ML modeling**, and **cloud computing**.

## 🛠️ Skills and Tools
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, SQL, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Kotlin
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache Spark, Airflow, Flask, React, Node.js, Selenium
- **Tools & Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Tableau, PowerBI, Looker

## 🚀 What I'm working on
- 🚧 **Developing a Stronger Understanding of E2E ML Pipelines**: I'm learning to build and optimize machine learning pipelines. I'm specifically focused on tools like Airflow for orchestration and Flask for API deployment.
- 🔍 **Exploring Computer Vision Systems**: I'm exploring into computer vision and deep learning using frameworks like TensorFlow. This interest stems from my experience improving text and object recognition accuracy in real-world scenarios
- 🧠 **Enhancing My Skills in Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: I've been exporing NLP for text classification, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition.  I built a project analyzing tweets to find socio-demographic trends. It wasn't a groundbreaking success (yet), but I've been brushing up on tools and can't wait to revisit this project with fresh ideas and new skills.

- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not crunching numbers or watching video lectures, I'm probably perfecting my experimental baking recipes (results are... mixed but improving!) or lifting weights I have absolutely no business lifting.
