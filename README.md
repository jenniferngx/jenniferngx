## Hi, I'm Jennifer Nguyen, a new CompSci/Math grad from Colgate University 👋

## 🌟 About Me
- 💡 **Data and Software Dev**: I started out with programming but ended up loving building tools and systems to extract insights from data. 
- 🎯 **Exploring new tools**: I get restless when I'm not learning/doing something new. Currently expanding my skills in **data analysis**, **ML modeling**, and **cloud computing**.

## 🛠️ Skills and Tools
- **Programming Languages**: Python, R, SQL, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Kotlin
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache Spark, Airflow, Flask, React, Node.js, Selenium
- **Tools & Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud, BigQuery, Tableau, PowerBI, Looker

## 🚀 What I'm working on
- **E2E ML Pipelines**:

  I'm learning to build and optimize machine learning pipelines. Right now I'm interested in tools like Airflow for orchestration and Flask for API deployment.
- **Exploring Computer Vision Systems**:

  I'm exploring into computer vision and deep learning using frameworks like TensorFlow. This interest stems from my experience improving text and object recognition accuracy in real-world scenarios
- **Enhancing Skills in NLP**:

  I've been exporing NLP for text classification, sentiment analysis, and entity recognition. I built a social media analysis project to find socio-demographic trends. It wasn't a groundbreaking success (yet), but I've been brushing up on tools and can't wait to revisit this project with fresh ideas and new skills.

## 📫 Up close:
- 💬 **How to reach me**: trang.nguyen.do.ha@gmail.com
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: When I'm not crunching numbers or watching video lectures, I'm probably perfecting my experimental baking recipes (results are... mixed but improving!) or lifting weights I have absolutely no business lifting.
